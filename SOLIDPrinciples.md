## What is SOLID?

SOLID is a set of principles for software design that when used with object-oriented programming and design helps achieve code that can be easily extended and maintained. The term SOLID stands for the following principles:   

- Single Responsibility Principle
  - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

- Open-Closed Principle
  - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

- Interface Segregation Principle
  - Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

- Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
